IONIC FRAMEWORK

First, install Node.js. Then, install the latest Ionic command-line tools in your terminal. Follow the Android and iOS platform guides to install required tools for development.
npm install -g ionic


Much of your app can be built right in the browser with ionic serve. We recommend starting with this workflow.
ionic serve or ionic serve --lab
